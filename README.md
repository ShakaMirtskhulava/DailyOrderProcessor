# Daily Order Processor Worker

In our Order Management System (OMS), we needed a background service to process orders at the end of each day. This service aggregates daily orders for reporting and synchronizes them with external systems (e.g., ERP, customer loyalty, shipping partners).

## Implementation

We implemented this using:

- **`BackgroundService`** in ASP.NET Core for handling the periodic task execution.
- **`Task.Run`** for parallel task execution to speed up aggregation and synchronization.
- **`Parallel.ForEach`** to process orders concurrently.
- **`ManualResetEvent`** to ensure proper synchronization between tasks.

This approach improves system performance and ensures timely, efficient order processing.
