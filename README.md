#Daily Order Processor Worker
In our Order Management System (OMS), we needed a background service to process orders at the end of each day. This service aggregates daily orders for reporting and synchronizes them with external systems (e.g., ERP, customer loyalty, shipping partners).

We implemented this using BackgroundService in ASP.NET Core to handle the periodic task execution. For concurrency, we leveraged Task.Run for parallel task execution and Parallel.ForEach to synchronize orders concurrently. Additionally, ManualResetEvent ensures proper synchronization between tasks. This approach improves system performance and ensures timely, efficient order processing.
